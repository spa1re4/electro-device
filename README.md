Project Description: Device Management Application
Overview
The Device Management Application is a JavaFX-based program that allows users to manage different types of electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops, and tablets. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface for adding, viewing, and removing devices, while utilizing object-oriented programming principles to model the various device types.

Features
Device Management: Users can add new devices with specific attributes, view a list of added devices, and remove devices from the list.
Dynamic Input Fields: The input fields for device attributes change dynamically based on the selected device type (smartphone, laptop, or tablet), ensuring that users only enter relevant information.
Validation: The application includes basic validation to ensure all required fields are filled in and that numerical inputs are valid.
User Feedback: Users receive feedback messages indicating successful additions or removals of devices, as well as error messages for invalid inputs.
User Interface Components
ListView: Displays the list of devices currently managed by the application.
TextFields: Allows users to input device attributes such as name, price, weight, and specific parameters depending on the selected device type.
RadioButtons: Enables users to select the type of device they want to add (smartphone, laptop, or tablet), which dynamically updates the input fields.
Labels: Provides feedback messages and instructions to users.
Functionality
Adding Devices:
Users can fill in details about the device, including name, price, weight, and type-specific attributes.
Upon clicking the 'Add' button, the device is created and added to the ListView.
Deleting Devices:
Users can select a device from the ListView and remove it with the 'Delete' button.
Device Selection Handling:
The application listens for changes in the selected device type and adjusts the visible input fields accordingly.
Click Handling:
Clicking on a device in the ListView displays its details in a feedback label.
Technologies Used
JavaFX: For building the user interface.
FXML: For layout design, allowing separation of the user interface from the application logic.
Java: As the primary programming language for implementing the application's logic and features.
Conclusion
The Device Management Application serves as an educational project demonstrating the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts and JavaFX for GUI development. It showcases the ability to manage complex data structures (like devices) in a user-friendly manner, making it an excellent tool for learning and practice in software development.
